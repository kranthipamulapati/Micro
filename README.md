# Micro projects

Here are a bunch of small projects that I did for fun using plain javascript, html, css.

1. Tell me a joke

    An app that combines a Joke API that fetches a joke as plain text, and transforms it using a speech-to-text API. Volume up!

2. Infinity scroll

    Fetches images using the Unsplash API to show infinite scroll functionality.
    Fetches more images as you scroll but user sees no loading/blocking giving as illusion of infinity scroll.

3. Picture in Picture

    Gets a media stream from available display & plays it on a HTML5 video. The video can be made into a picture-in-picture.

4. Count Down

    A simple count down timer in your browser.

5. Calculator

    A simple calculator that can do basic math.

6. Drag N Drop

    A to-do board with Drag and Drop functionality.
